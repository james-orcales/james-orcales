# Anta docs site (`site/`)

This is the documentation site for `@antadesign/anta`, deployed at anta.design. It is **not** part of the published npm package — anything that ships to consumers lives in the repo root (`src/`, `dist/`).

Stack: Astro 5 static output, Preact islands (`@astrojs/preact`, with `compat: true` so `react` aliases to `preact/compat`), MDX for component pages, astro-expressive-code for syntax-highlighted code blocks, Monaco editor for the interactive playground.

The docs site consumes Anta via the workspace symlink (`"@antadesign/anta": "workspace:*"`), so Anta must be built first (`pnpm run build` at the repo root) before `site/` resolves `dist/` artifacts.

## CSS

- **All component styles stay co-located** (a `.astro` scoped `<style>` or a `.module.css`). `astro.config.mjs` sets `build.inlineStylesheets: 'never'` so scoped styles are emitted into *linked* bundles, never inlined into the page `<head>` — Astro's per-page inline path can land present-but-inert in production for a component used inside MDX wrapping a hydrated island. Per-route CSS code-splitting stays on (default), so heavy island CSS (Monaco/Playground) loads only where it's used.
- For a one-off style that must stay inline and untouched by Astro's pipeline, use **`<style is:inline>`** — it's rendered verbatim (no scoping, bundling, or hoisting).
- **In MDX docs pages, a styling example's live CSS goes in a `<style is:inline>` placed *inside* its `<Preview>` (as a child, after the element), targeting a demo class on that preview's element; the folded recipe under the preview is that same CSS.** Putting the `<style>` inside the preview means the applied rule is literally in the preview's DOM, right next to the element it styles — a reader can inspect the preview and find exactly the rule the recipe shows — and it's never a far-away or page-wide stylesheet. Don't hide the applied CSS behind a `style=""` attribute either: an attribute can't express what these examples need (`::part`, `::before`, `:hover`, `:state`, descendant selectors) — those are only legal in a stylesheet. Use a demo class (e.g. `.hide-chevron`, `.code-like`) so each example is self-identifying and examples don't collide, and tell the reader (once, near the first example) that the class is just for the demo and they'd swap their own selector. `expander.mdx`'s "Styling the chevron & header" section is the reference pattern.
- **`pnpm --filter anta-site lint:css` runs Stylelint** (config: `site/stylelint.config.mjs`) over `src/**/*.{css,astro}`, including the `<style>` blocks inside `.astro` files (`postcss-html` custom syntax). It's a CI step. The config is tuned for *correctness*, not house style — most stylistic rules are off; the point is to catch CSS that the browser would silently drop. **Watch for `*/` inside a CSS comment** — e.g. writing `data-*/aria-*` ends the comment early and spills the rest into the stylesheet as invalid CSS, which (when bundled with other components) silently drops their rules in production. Stylelint now flags this.

## Playground

The `<Playground>` component (`site/src/components/Playground.tsx`) is the playground that lands on `/components/<name>/` pages. It is the largest single component in this directory and is intentionally self-contained so that a future migration to a dedicated package (`@antadesign/sandbox` or similar) and a dedicated repository can lift it out without disturbing the rest of the site.

Supporting code:

- `site/lib/sandbox/` — `bundler.ts`, `modules.ts`, `prop-patch.ts`, `prop-read.ts`, `props-form.ts`, `locate-tag.ts`. These are the long-lived primitives. When the sandbox moves to its own package, these go with it; the docs site is left with just `Playground.tsx` consuming the extracted package.
  - **`modules.ts` maps the imports the sandbox exposes to playground code.** The whole `@antadesign/anta` barrel is exposed automatically — `moduleManifest['@antadesign/anta']` and `getDemoModules()['@antadesign/anta']` are both derived from `Object.keys(import * as anta)`, so **any component (current or future) is importable/passable as children with no edit here**. Other paths (`preact`, `preact/hooks`, `@antadesign/anta/elements` side-effect) stay curated — add a new *non-anta* module to **both** the manifest and `getDemoModules()`, or `import { X }` resolves to `undefined` and the preview renders blank.
- `site/scripts/copy-esbuild-wasm.mjs` — copies `esbuild.wasm` into `site/public/` so the iframe can fetch `/esbuild.wasm` directly.
- `site/scripts/build-iframe-runtime.mjs` — pre-builds `site/public/iframe-anta-runtime.js`, a self-contained ESM bundle of `@antadesign/anta/elements` + per-element CSS that the iframe dynamic-imports to register custom elements on its own `customElements` registry.

### Monaco is bundled from npm (no CDN)

Monaco lives in `dependencies` as `monaco-editor` and is bundled by Vite into the playground's lazy chunk. The wiring is in `Playground.tsx`'s mount effect:

```ts
import('monaco-editor')                                                         // namespace
import('monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker?worker')                      // fallback worker
import('monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/ts.worker?worker')             // TS service
import('monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/css/css.worker?worker')                   // CSS tab
import('@monaco-editor/react')                                                  // React wrapper
```

After load, `MonacoEnvironment.getWorker(_, label)` returns a fresh `Worker` for `typescript`/`javascript` (ts.worker), `css`/`scss`/`less` (css.worker), and anything else (editor.worker). `loader.config({ monaco: monacoNs })` is what makes `@monaco-editor/react` skip its default CDN fetch.

Trade-off: ~1.5 MB Monaco enters the `/components/<name>/` lazy chunk. The docs site is self-contained — no third-party JS fetch, offline-correct, and the runtime version is whatever `package.json` says.

We only register workers for languages the playground actually uses. Adding JSON/HTML support means adding two more `?worker` imports and switch arms.

## Adding a component docs page

Create `site/src/pages/components/{name}.mdx` with `layout: ../../layouts/DocsLayout.astro`. For an interactive demo, drop `<Playground client:visible component="…" layout="side" initialCode={…} />` near the top.

**Always use the shared `<Playground>` for the interactive demo — never hand-roll a bespoke per-component playground island.** The shared one gives a uniform editor + auto props form (from `api.json`) + isolated preview iframe across every page, and is slated for extraction into its own package; a one-off island fragments that and drifts. The `initialCode` is plain TSX — imports followed by a trailing JSX block that the bundler auto-wraps in a `<>…</>` fragment, so it can hold **multiple sibling or nested elements** (e.g. several anchors each wrapping a `<Tooltip>`); the props panel binds to the first instance of `component`. Keep `initialCode` in a sibling `{name}.demo.ts` (`export default \`…\``) so Astro's MDX pipeline doesn't mangle the template literal's indentation. Reserve custom islands for demos the playground genuinely can't express (e.g. a self-animating `AnimatedProgress`).

The preview iframe loads `tokens.css` + `reset.css` + the registered elements via `site/scripts/build-iframe-runtime.mjs` (→ `public/iframe-anta-runtime.js`), so component CSS that references `--bg-*` / `--text-*` / `--border-*` resolves the same as on the docs site. If a new component's appearance depends on a stylesheet not in that bundle, add it there.

**`site/src/layouts/element-host-styles.css` is a hand-maintained aggregator** — it `@import`s every element's `dist/elements/a-*.css` so `DocsLayout.astro` can link the host/light-DOM chrome render-blocking in `<head>` (otherwise the element CSS only arrives when the client `@antadesign/anta/elements` JS registers the elements, flashing an unstyled box on load). **When you add a new component, add its `a-{name}.css` `@import` here too** (the same manual step as `build:css` and `elements/index.ts`), or its host chrome will flash before upgrade on the docs site.

```sh
pnpm run dev                 # ← run from the REPO ROOT (see below); the dev command for all work
cd site && pnpm run build    # static build (site only)
```

**Run the dev server with `pnpm run dev` from the repo root, not `cd site && pnpm run dev`.** The root command runs the site's `astro dev` *and* a `nodemon` watcher that rebuilds anta's `dist` on `src` changes, so package edits propagate to the running site; the site-only command does not rebuild anta. (See "Running the dev server" in the root `CLAUDE.md`.)

The site's own `pnpm run dev` (which the root command invokes under the hood) chains through `docs:api` (typedoc → `src/api.json`), `docs:pages` (regenerate index.mdx from README.md), `docs:wasm` (copy esbuild.wasm), and `docs:iframe-runtime` (rebuild iframe runtime) before starting Astro.

## Docs prose style

Component-page copy should be **precise, concrete, and said once** — dense with information but not with words. The failure mode here is the four-clause run-on stitched together with em-dashes and parentheticals. Check every sentence against these:

- **Lead with the point.** A section's first sentence states what the thing *is* or *does*; details follow. No throat-clearing ("In this section we'll look at…").
- **One idea per sentence.** Two em-dashes or two parentheticals in a sentence means it's doing too much — split it.
- **Don't narrate the props table.** `PropsTable` already lists names, types, and defaults; prose adds only what a table can't — *when* to reach for a prop, gotchas, interactions. Never restate each value as a sentence.
- **Show over tell.** A short code block beats a paragraph describing the code.
- **Cut filler.** Drop "simply / just / basically / note that"; "in order to" → "to", "is able to" → "can", "a number of" → "several".
- **Active voice, present tense, second person.** "Pass `open` to control it," not "`open` can be passed."
- **Say each fact once**, in its most relevant section; cross-reference rather than repeat.
- **Concrete, not vague.** "24px tall," not "appropriately sized."

This tightens the existing voice — it doesn't dumb it down. Keep the technical depth; cut the word count. `input.mdx` is the worked reference for the tightened style.

## Component reference tables

- **Props table is automatic.** `<PropsTable component="Button" />` derives everything from `src/api.json` (typedoc) and `PropsTable.astro` owns the rendering, so it's uniform across pages — don't hand-format props. How it renders (for reference, all in `PropsTable.astro`): prop name = monospace, weight 475, no code pill; the optional `?` is a separate `--text-5` element with `user-select: none` (double-click selects just the name, copy omits the `?`); the type column lists each union member on its own line (no `|`), with **type names** (`string`/`number`/`boolean` and named types like `IconShape`) as plain `--text-3` monospace and **literal values** as copyable `<code>` pills with the surrounding quotes stripped (e.g. `neutral`); "no value" em-dashes in the Type/Default columns use `--text-5`.
- **Each component page ends with a `## Styling` `<Disclosure>`, not a token table.** Per the root CLAUDE.md "Documented styling surface" doctrine, it leads with the props + the single `--{component}-tone-source` custom-colour knob, then shows how to customise everything else with **plain CSS** (light-DOM components) or **`::part(...)`** (shadow-DOM components) — with a short `tsx folded` / `css folded` example. Do **not** enumerate the internal per-state output tokens (`--*-fill*`, `--*-bg`, `--*-fg`, …) as an override table, and examples must not set those `--*` vars. If you do list a kept knob (`--*-tone-source`, `--checkbox-mask-*`, `--expander-gutter`), it stays normal `` `code` `` (copyable code-pill styling is automatic).
