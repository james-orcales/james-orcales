 *
 * Uncontrolled (`defaultOpen`): the element owns its open state. The wrapper
 * emits `default-state="open"` — never `state` — so the DOM carries no stale
 * controlled attribute. Controlled (`open` + `onStateChange`): the wrapper
 * emits `state="open" | "closed"`; the element treats the attribute as the
 * source of truth and clicks only dispatch the cancelable `statechange` event,
 * giving real controlled semantics (a consumer can reject a toggle). See
 * STATEFUL-COMPONENTS.md.
