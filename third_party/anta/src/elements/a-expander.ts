/**
 * `<a-expander>` — a collapsible disclosure, built from our own shadow
 * DOM (no native `<details>`/`<summary>`).
 *
 * Light-DOM composition (what the wrapper emits / a vanilla consumer
 * authors) uses two styled sub-elements:
 *
 *   <a-expander>
 *     <a-expander-summary slot="title">Title</a-expander-summary>
 *     <a-expander-details>…body…</a-expander-details>
 *   </a-expander>
 *
 * Shadow structure — every node carries a stable label (a part name or
 * a class, both shadow-scoped: invisible to consumer selectors, pure
 * documentation + styling hooks):
 *
 *   <div class="header">       flex row: the trigger + header actions
 *     <button part="summary">  the summary; chevron is its ::before; the
 *       <slot name="title">    title is projected here
 *     <slot name="actions">    header actions — SIBLINGS of the button,
 *                              never inside it: clicks on them don't
 *                              toggle (no propagation path through the
 *                              button) and AT sees separate controls.
 *                              A flex row that never shrinks or wraps —
 *                              under width pressure the title ellipsizes
 *                              first, actions keep their intrinsic size.
 *                              display:none while empty (toggled by a
 *                              slotchange listener — CSS can't express
 *                              "slot has assigned nodes"), so an
 *                              actionless header reserves no space.
 *                              Visible in both folded and open states —
 *                              the header represents the section either
 *                              way (the MUI / GitHub convention).
 *   <div class="region">       the grid that animates height
 *     <slot part="content">    the body — this slot IS the grid item the
 *                              fr-track sizes (styled display:block) and
 *                              clips while animating; it projects the body
 *                              directly, no wrapper div
 *
 * ## Open state — the `state` contract (see STATEFUL-COMPONENTS.md)
 *
 * - **Uncontrolled** (no `state` attribute): the element owns its state.
 *   Clicking the summary toggles it; `default-state="open"` seeds the
 *   initial state (read once at connect). This is the hand-authored mode.
 * - **Controlled** (`state="open"`/`"closed"` present): the attribute is the
 *   single source of truth. Clicks do NOT self-toggle; they only dispatch the
 *   cancelable `statechange` event and the consumer answers by updating
 *   `state`. A consumer can reject by simply not updating. If you set `state`,
 *   you own it; absence keeps meaning "uncontrolled".
 *
 * Either way the element fires **`statechange`** — `cancelable`, *before* it
 * applies anything — with `detail: { next, prev }` in the `'open'|'closed'`
 * vocabulary. Uncontrolled, a handler can veto the transition synchronously
 * with `preventDefault()` (the element gates its own apply on the dispatch
 * result); controlled, `preventDefault()` is moot (the element never
 * self-applies) and not-updating-`state` is the reject.
 *
 * The internal open state lives in the shadow: `aria-expanded` on the
 * button (BOTH the a11y signal and the CSS state hook — no extra class)
 * plus `inert` on the collapsed region so hidden content leaves the tab
 * order and the a11y tree. Nothing on the host is ever mutated from JS
 * (declarative-DOM rule: the host may be reconciled off the UI thread).
 * `aria-controls` is intentionally omitted: optional in the WAI-ARIA
 * disclosure pattern, poorly supported, and would force a generated id.
 *
 * The open state is also mirrored to a custom state via `ElementInternals`
 * (`:state(open)`) purely as a *styling hook* for consumers — e.g. rotating a
 * chevron placed in `actions`, or matching an open header to a design. This is
 * declarative-DOM-safe: a custom state is element-internal, not a host
 * attribute, so it never mutates the host DOM. Guarded for engines without
 * `attachInternals` (it just doesn't expose the hook there).
 *
 * ## Shadow style notes (the sheet itself ships comment-free)
 *
 * - **Summary**: a real `<button>` (free focus + Enter/Space), reset to
 *   inherit the host's box/text so it reads as a plain header row. Its
 *   typography (default + per-`[level]` rules) is generated from
 *   `SUMMARY_TYPE_SCALE` below — the one place to keep in sync with the
 *   `a-title.css` type scale (`a-title` is CSS-only, so there is no
 *   shared constant to import). Deliberately NOT exposed as
 *   `--expander-summary-*` tokens: `level` covers the supported
 *   variation, the weight never varies, and `::part(summary)` is the
 *   escape hatch for bespoke restyling — component tokens are reserved
 *   for values external CSS must re-point (tone, surface, dark mode).
 * - **Chevron**: the button's `::before` — a mask painting with
 *   `currentColor` (the inherited, possibly toned `--expander-text`); dimmed at
 *   rest, full on hover/open, rotated 90° when open (the rotate composes with
 *   the vertical-centering `translateY(-50%)`). It's positioned ABSOLUTELY
 *   inside the gutter (`left: var(--expander-gutter) - 16px - 2px`, so its right
 *   edge sits 2px before the gutter — a 2px gap before the title), out of flow,
 *   so it never pushes the title — the title's inset is purely `--expander-gutter`
 *   (the same var the body uses). With `outdent` the gutter is 0, so the
 *   chevron auto-hangs at -18px in the negative gutter and the title sits flush
 *   with the surrounding content. (The 1px transparent border stays — it keeps
 *   tertiary content aligned with the filled priorities — so a -1px correction
 *   on the header + region cancels its content-box inset; see the SHADOW_STYLE
 *   outdent rule.)
 *   The chevron can't be hidden via an attribute (a foldable region needs a
 *   visible affordance) — restyle or remove it through ::part(summary)::before.
 * - **Hover/press affordance**: the button's `:hover`/`:active` set its
 *   own `color` (to `--expander-text-hover` / `--expander-text`); the
 *   slotted title and the `currentColor` chevron both follow by plain
 *   property inheritance across the slot boundary. Deliberately NOT
 *   `button:hover ::slotted(…)`: Chromium fails to invalidate slotted
 *   styles when an ancestor's hover state changes across a gradual pointer
 *   exit, leaving the hover look stuck (reproduced in Chrome 149;
 *   single-jump exits invalidate fine). Property inheritance propagates
 *   reliably where selector invalidation doesn't. Driving `color` (rather
 *   than a private var the title reads) is also what lets a consumer's
 *   `::part(summary):hover { color }` reach the title — the outer `::part`
 *   rule overrides this inner one and inheritance carries it through. The
 *   tradeoff: a custom title node with no explicit `color` now inherits the
 *   hover recolour too (set `color` on it to opt out). The tertiary surface
 *   adds the docs-header dotted underline via `--_summary-underline`, the
 *   one bit still scoped to `a-expander-summary` (text-decoration doesn't
 *   inherit usefully here). Press eases title + (closed) chevron back to the
 *   at-rest look as soft feedback; the underline intentionally stays (no
 *   flicker). The `:active` rule mirrors its `:hover` counterpart's
 *   specificity and follows it in source order, so it wins while pressed.
 * - **Collapse animation**: grid `0fr ↔ 1fr` on `.region` (`ANIM_MS`),
 *   keyed off the button's `aria-expanded`; the `[part="content"]` grid
 *   item clips (`overflow: clip`) while animating. The grid item is the
 *   `<slot>` itself, promoted to `display: block` so it generates a box and
 *   acts as the fr-sized grid track — a `display: contents` slot (the UA
 *   default) has no box and wouldn't size the track, which is why the slot
 *   carries `display: block` rather than projecting through a wrapper. Once open and
 *   idle the clip is dropped (delayed by `ANIM_MS` via a discrete
 *   `overflow` transition) so focus rings / nested popovers aren't cut
 *   off. Known degradation: without `transition-behavior:
 *   allow-discrete` (Firefox < 129, Safari < 18) the un-clip applies
 *   instantly on open, so expanding content paints outside the still-
 *   animating region for `ANIM_MS` — accepted, it's a one-frame-class
 *   cosmetic on a progressive-enhancement property.
 *
 * - **Disabled** (`disabled`, presence-based): the shadow button gets the
 *   native `disabled` — unfocusable, unclickable, no hover affordance
 *   (the hover/press rules are gated on `:enabled`). The open state
 *   freezes as-is (matching Radix / native form controls — disabling
 *   doesn't force-close). Host CSS dims the text; header actions stay
 *   live (they're outside the button) unless the consumer disables them.
 * - **Outdent**: `outdent` (tertiary only) hangs the chevron in the left
 *   gutter and drops the body's chevron-alignment indent (see
 *   a-expander.css) so the title + content line up flush with the
 *   surrounding column, like the docs section headers.
 * - **Open-state selectors** cross from the button to `.region` via
 *   `.header:has(button[aria-expanded="true"]) + .region` — the button
 *   sits inside the header flex row, so plain sibling combinators can't
 *   reach the region anymore.
 *
 * ## Host CSS notes (`a-expander.css` — also ships comment-free)
 *
 * - The external file styles the HOST box and declares the theme tokens
 *   that cascade — via `color` + custom properties — into the shadow
 *   tree. Named tones use Anta's theme-aware semantic tokens, so no
 *   `.dark` rules are needed (same as `<a-tag>`).
 * - The host carries no padding — the header `<button>` (full width + height)
 *   owns the content inset via `--expander-gutter`, the single value the title
 *   inset, the body inset, AND the chevron position all derive from (24px
 *   default; the chevron sits absolutely in it). So the title's left rhythm is
 *   constant for every `level`, the body always lines up under it, and the hit
 *   area is the whole header. The border is present on every priority
 *   (transparent on tertiary) so switching priority never shifts layout.
 *   `secondary` is the default surface; `primary` re-points to the stronger
 *   card pair; `tertiary` goes transparent. `outdent` (tertiary only) sets
 *   `--expander-gutter: 0` so title + body go flush with surrounding content
 *   and the chevron auto-hangs in the negative gutter; the transparent border
 *   stays (a -1px shadow correction cancels its 1px content-box inset).
 * - `<a-expander-summary>` / `<a-expander-details>` are CSS-only styled
 *   light-DOM tags (like `<a-tag-label>`). The summary inherits the
 *   shadow button's typography and only lays out + ellipsizes; the
 *   details own only layout (the indent) — no typography, so content
 *   keeps its own.
 * - Custom (non-named) `tone` keeps the source hue and pins lightness/
 *   chroma per token via `oklch(from …)`, re-tuned for dark mode — the
 *   `<a-tag>` / `<a-button>` mechanism. The JSX wrapper feeds the color
 *   in via inline `--expander-tone-source`; the typed
 *   `attr(tone type(<color>))` fallback covers raw-HTML authors on
 *   engines that support it.
