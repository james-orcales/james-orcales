class Connection:
    """
    The server-side half of the Hegel wire protocol. The other half is the client, and
    is intended to be a Hegel library like hegel-rust.

    The intended use is for a single connection to be used for the entire test suite.
    A connection can be used simultaneously by multiple tests.

    At the lowest level, the protocol is bytes moving across the transport layer. The
    transport layer is the server subprocess's stdin/stdout. Bytes sent over the
    transport always consist of logical packets (see the Packet class). Packets on
    the protocol have a stream_id, which logically organizes packets. See the
    Stream class for details.

    Protocol
    --------

    A high-level description of the full protocol between a server and a client.

    Handshake
    ~~~~~~~~~

    The protocol between a server and a client starts with a handshake:

    - The client sends a packet on the control stream with payload
      b"hegel_handshake_start"
    - The server responds with a packet on the control stream with payload
      b"Hegel/{PROTOCOL_VERSION}"

    Test case lifetime
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    After the handshake, the lifetime of a test on the protocol is:

    - The client sends a {"command": "run_test"} cbor packet on the control
      stream. The payload includes a stream_id C1 and various test settings.
    - The server responds with a reply packet containing the cbor payload True.
    - We now start sending and executing test cases. The server sends a
      {"event": "test_case", "stream_id": C2} cbor packet on stream C1.
      C2 is conceptually the stream for this specific test case.
    - The client sends a {"command": ...} cbor packet, typically "generate",
      on C2. The server responds with an appropriate cbor packet, typically the result
      of drawing from the requested schema.
    - The client repeats until it sends a {"command": "mark_complete"} cbor packet,
      at which point the server breaks out of its listening loop.
    - The server sends a {"event": "test_done", "results": ...} cbor packet on C1.
    - For any test cases which were marked complete with status "interesting", the
      server repeats the test case loop, but now with the {"event": "test_case"} cbor
      packet including `"is_final": True`.
